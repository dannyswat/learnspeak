- Create prompt templates for consistency

#### 3. Scope Creep
**Risk**: Timeline extends indefinitely  
**Mitigation**:
- Strict MVP definition (P0 features only)
- Move P1/P2 to backlog
- Regular sprint reviews
- Time-box feature development

#### 4. Performance Issues
**Risk**: Slow page loads with media  
**Mitigation**:
- Lazy loading for images
- Audio file compression
- CDN for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Early performance testing
